##### *GAME CONTENT*

A 3D horror game featuring the Rat (player), the Father, the Mother, the Children, the Cat, and a house full of food going to waste. Players must search a two story house for any scraps, whether is on the table, in the bed, or on the floor. The Rat must get hazards, mouse traps, and the patrolling family. There are mouse holes around the house to act as safe passageways between rooms or as hiding spots. Victory is only achived when the Rat's hunger is satisfied.
